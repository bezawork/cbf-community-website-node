<p>
  On Wednesday April 10th 2019,
  <a href="https://codingblackfemales.com">Coding Black Females</a> had a great
  meetup at the dxw digital offices. We heard from Efua Akumanyi, the Co-Founder
  of Furnishful, and David Mann the MD at dxw digital.
</p>
<h3>Efua Akumanyi</h3>

  <a href="https://twitter.com/efuaakumanyi">Efua Akumanyi</a> Co-Founded
  <a href="https://www.furnishful.co.uk/">Furnishful</a> in 2016, a shopping
  discovery site for furniture and homewares. She has been a software developer
  for over 15 years. She has worked in various sectors during her career
  (medical, legal, insurance, start-ups, e-commerce and charities).
</p>
<p>
  Efua became a member of Coding Black Females in 2018, and since then has been
  a great support and inspiration to other members of the group.
</p>
<h4>Furnishful</h4>
<p>
  In Efua’s presentation about Furnishful, she spoke about the background of the
  site. We were given an insight into the way they will be using AI, and how we
  could use AI in our applications.

<p>
  Furnishful currently aggregates products from over 40 retailers, and uses text
  search, categories and filters in order to find results.
</p>
<p>
  They are in the process of implementing an image search which will use
  Artificial Intelligence in order to find results based on images that the user
  has supplied, and then provide results from multiple retailers.
</p>
<p>
  We sat in awe listening to Efua as she shared details about how she and her
  partner built the company from the ground up to what it is today.

<p>
  Talks like this are a great inspiration to members of the Coding Black Females
  group and make people more likely to be interested in taking up technology
  based roles.
</p>
<h3>dxw digital</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.dxw.com/">dxw digital</a> have been supporting Coding
  Black Females since February 2019. One of our members,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/oecampbell">Olivia Campbell,</a> works for dxw
  digital, and they offered to host meetups for us whilst providing us with food
  and drink. This has meant that we are able to host our sessions more
  regularly, and reach more members of the community.

<p>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/dmann_ldn">David Mann</a> gave us a very
  inspirational talk about team work, and the benefits of having diverse teams
  to get the best results on projects. At dxw digital, they are actively working
  towards building a team which is more diverse and representative of our
  society.
</p>
<blockquote>
  Diverse teams give diverse perspectives, which leads to better outcomes on
  projects.
</blockquote>
<p>
  He gave a brief history about the first programmers and the fact that they
  were women. If you’ve seen Hidden Figures, then you’ll recognise some of the
  names he mentioned.

  He reminded us that the tech industry is also ours, and we should make sure
  that we take our place.
</p>
<h3>Code Together</h3>
<p>
  Following on from the talks, we had about an hour and a half to focus on doing
  some coding. The sessions that we have at Coding Black Females typically have
  women at all stages of their career, so some of us focussed on developing our
  <a href="http://community.codingblackfemales.com">community website</a>, and
  the rest used the time to improve their knowledge and understanding of HTML,
  CSS, JavaScript and Python.
</p>
<p>
  Our coding environment is a rich one, with a lot of enjoyment and support for
  each other. People are able to freely ask questions, give suggestions, and try
  out things they haven’t done before.
